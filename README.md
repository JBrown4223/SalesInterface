<h2>SalesInterface</h2>

<p>This program works as an interface for the user to view organized sales data from a csv file. I used arrays as my data structure and merge sort to sort the data from highest to lowest. The main function acts as a menu where the user can select which data they'd like to see. The program will not close until specified by the user to close</p>
